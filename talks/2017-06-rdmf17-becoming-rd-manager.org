This talk is largely reflection and conjecture

I hope you enjoy it anyway!

These are my own opinions…

…formed from my experience /and/ talking to people in the sector…

…and don't necessarily represent any one institution

* A little bit about me

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
Be able to work both independently and collaboratively

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
Be agile and work with what you've got

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
/Libraries at research-intensive universities/

*** Key learning point

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
Work flexibly and don't make assumptions

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
+Ignore+ Cross traditional silo boundaries

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
Build consensus and bring people with you on the journey

** Where next?

My job is fulfilling: interesting, varied and rewarding \\
/i.e. I'm not going anywhere soon/

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
but I do have a stated aim to make myself redundant, so…

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
- Research?
- Data science?
- Consultancy?
- Software development?
- /Any suggestions?/

* The wider profession 
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ./images/laptops.jpg
:END:

/I.e. enough about me!/

** What does a research data manager do?

#+BEGIN_two-column

#+BEGIN_column
Reviewing DMPs

Writing documentation

Teaching (and developing teaching materials)

Planning

Project management
#+END_column

#+BEGIN_column
Community building

Infrastructure building 

Policy development

Service evaluation

...
#+END_column

#+END_two-column

** Where do we get those skills?

#+BEGIN_two-column

#+BEGIN_column
Librarians

Archivists

Researchers

Technicians

Data scientists
#+END_column

#+BEGIN_column
IT professionals

Research support professionals

Project managers

QA professionals
#+END_column

#+END_two-column

** Where do they work?

And what does that mean?

*** Library

Metadata; Access; Information Management

*** Research Office

Policy compliance; Risk management

*** IT Services

Technology; Infrastructure

*** Academic departments

Local, subject-specific needs; tactical rather than strategic

* Challenges
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ./images/question.jpg
:END:

** Challenge 1: funding is difficult right now

RDM skillset is valuable, and valued outside HE

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
Hard to recruit and retain talented people

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
Hard to justify expanding teams to meet demand

** Challenge 2: no obvious career path

People come from diverse backgrounds…

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
…which is /why/ we recruit them

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
But traditional promotion structures don't value that diversity

** Challenge 3: it's a new and fragmented profession

It's hard to find a local community

* Solutions
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ./images/idea.jpg
:END:

** Continue making business case for institutional RDM support

Sadly, money is important

** Develop a career model for research data managers

If we want to recruit, develop and retain talent…

…we need to give people scope for development

*** Research career model
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ./images/mrc-career-framework.png
:END:

*** Professional services career model

Move around to get experience /within your service/

Move up to positions of wider, more strategic responsibility

*** Research software engineering

Lobby universities & funders to:

- acknowledge contributions
- fund specific posts for RSEs

*** Research data managers

Some ideas:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
Encourage freedom of movement across department boundaries

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
Aim to build capacity within departments and faculties

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
Work with other communities (e.g. RSE)

** Continue community building

Seek out and welcome new constituencies

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
/e.g. technicians, postdocs, RSEs/

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
Sector bodies cooperate to build a home and a voice for our profession \\
/DCC, Jisc, DPC, CODATA, …/

** Provide a range of opportunities

Build skills: e.g. Library Carpentry

Build experience: e.g. secondments, job shadowing, new posts

* Conclusions

** Right now…

RDM is new and exciting...

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
...which means attracting talent isn't too difficult

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
But this will change!

** For the future…

We need to make sure we can recruit /and retain/ talented people

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
We're well on the way, but we're not there yet!

* Acknowledgements

/Literally/ hundreds of people who have supported me in my career and given me the opportunities that have put me here today

* Notes :noexport:

- Became research data manager by accident
- My background:
  - Degree in maths & computer science
  - Never quite completed PhD in computational systems biology
- I am typical because I am not typical?
- Depends on
  - Who had enough of an interest, plus skills, experience and credibility within institution  to start investigating and making the business case
  - Who (at a senior level) could be persuaded first to do something about it
- Departments
  - Library
    - Focus on metadata, access, information management
  - IT services
    - Focus on technology & infrastructure (spinning disks)
  - Research office
    - Focus on policy compliance and risk management
- Other people in RDM roles
  - Librarians
  - Archivists
  - Ex-postdocs
  - IT folk
  - Research office folk
  - Project managers
- Typical daily activities
  - Reviewing DMPs
  - Writing documentation
  - Teaching (and developing teaching materials)
  - Planning
  - Project management
  - Policy development
  - Service evaluation
  - ...
- Relevant skills
  - Project management
  - Communication (all sorts!)
    - Written
      - Technical documentation
      - Persuasive reports
      - Informal news & opinions (e.g. blog)
    - Spoken
      - Large group presentations
      - 1-to-1 with students, postdocs and senior academics
  - Networking
  - Influencing
    - "Dogged consensus builder" ☺
  - Teaching
  - Policy development
  - Research experience
  - Metadata & information management
  - Technical data analysis & visualisation
  - Understanding of HE landscape
- I sometimes feel like we're looking for unicorns!
- Difficult to demonstrate & evidence need for services that don't exist yet, because nobody's using them!
- What onward career options are there for research data managers?
  - Senior library positions: tricky without library background
  - Senior IT positions
  - Senior research office positions
  - Academic research
- Hmm, all those options look like they will take skills and experience out of RDM
