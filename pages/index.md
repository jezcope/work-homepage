I help people use technology to let them focus on what matters most. I am currently responsible for research data management at the [University of Sheffield](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk). This includes:

- [ORDA (Online Research Data)](https://sheffield.figshare.com/), a platform for researchers to share their data with the world, powered by [figshare](https://figshare.com/institutions)
- Guidance, advice and templates for research data management, including data management planning, looking after data, and preservation & sharing
- Policy development
- Advocacy and outreach activities, including presentations to departments, institutes and research groups
- Consultancy and support on discipline-specific research data management projects

I'm based in the [University Library](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library), but work closely with colleagues in [Research & Innovation Services (RIS)](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/ris) and [Corporate Information & Computing Services (CICS)](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/cics).

I also blog sporadically about using technology to support research. Find me elsewhere on the web:
